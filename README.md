# 112-Term-Project
This will be my repo for my 15-112 Term Project

This is a game based around the original Pac-Man arcade game. It should work on
all Python 3.X versions; however, it was only tested using `Python 3.6.1`

The only required modules are PyGame. This was developed using `PyGame 1.9.3`
which can be installed using pip either through `python -m pip install pygame`
or 'pip install pygame' depending on your OS. *NOTE: Make sure to specify
python3 or pip3 depending on your OS's configuration* I can not guarantee
compatibility with future builds or older builds.

# Instructions
Once you clone the repository the way to run the game is to run the game.py file
and it should start everything.  Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man and you can
press escape at any given time to exit.  The goal of the game is to collect the
pellets while avoiding the ghosts.
