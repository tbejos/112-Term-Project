# 112-Term-Project
This will be my repo for my 15-112 Term Project

This is a game based around the original Pac-Man arcade game. It should work on
all Python 3.X versions; however, it was only tested using 'Python 3.6.1'

The only required modules are PyGame. This was developed using 'PyGame 1.9.3' and
I can not guarantee compatibility with future builds or older builds.

# Instructions
Once you clone the repository the way to run the game is to run the game.py file
and it should start everything. Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man and you can
press escape at any given time to exit. The goal of the game is to collect the
pellets while avoiding the ghosts.
