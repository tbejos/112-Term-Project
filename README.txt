# 112-Term-Project
This will be my repo for my 15-112 Term Project

This is a game based around the original Pac-Man arcade game. It should work on
all Python 3.X versions; however, it was only tested using `Python 3.6.1`

The only required modules are PyGame. This was developed using `PyGame 1.9.3`
which can be installed using pip either through `python -m pip install pygame`
or 'pip install pygame' depending on your OS. *NOTE: Make sure to specify
python3 or pip3 depending on your OS's configuration.* I can not guarantee
compatibility with future builds or older builds.

# Instructions
- Clone the repository; the way to run the game is to run the game.py file
and it should start everything.
- The goal of the game is to collect the pellets while avoiding the ghosts.
- Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man
- If you eat the large power-pellets then you are immune to ghosts (if you eat
  them you get 400 point bonus)
- If you clear the screen then it will reset and give you an extra life!
- Blinky (Red) will try and go straight for you, Inky (Blue) patrols and outer
square, Pinky (Pink) patrols an inner square, and Clyde (Orange) will make random
direction choices. Use these patterns to you advantage!
- You can press escape at any given time to exit.
- Have fun
